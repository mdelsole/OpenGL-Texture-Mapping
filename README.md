Objects in OpenGL are made of triangles. If we want to put an image onto an object, we'll need to tell OpenGL which part of of the image goes in each triangle. UV coordinates are how we do that.

Each vertex has a position, but it also has UV coordinates, specified as (u,v). Think of these as texture coordinates;
